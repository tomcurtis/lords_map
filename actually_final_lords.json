Before becoming an author, Archer was a Member of Parliament (1969\u201374), but resigned over a financial scandal which left him almost bankrupt.[2] Later, after a reversal in his fortunes from the royalties of his best-selling novels, he became deputy chairman of the Conservative Party (1985\u201386) before resigning after another scandal, which would lead to the end of his career in elected office.[3] He was made a life peer in 1992. His political career ended with his conviction and subsequent imprisonment (2001\u201303) for perjury and perverting the course of justice, which followed his second resignation. His books have sold at least 250 million copies worldwide.[4][5][6]",

He was a Member of Parliament for over 40 years (from 1952 until his retirement in 1992) and is the last surviving member of the cabinet formed by Harold Wilson after the Labour Party's victory in the 1964 general election. A major figure in the party, he was twice defeated in bids for the party leadership. Healey became well known for his trademark bushy eyebrows and his creative turns of phrase. During an interview with Nick Clarke on Radio 4, Denis Healey was the first Labour politician to publicly declare his wish for the Labour leadership to fall to Tony Blair in 1994 (following the death of Labour leader John Smith).",
